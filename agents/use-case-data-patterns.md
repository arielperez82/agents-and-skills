  Use this agent when you need to analyze how a user-facing use case maps to the underlying data access patterns and architectural implementation in the codebase. This agent should be invoked proactively when:

  <example> Context: Main agent is implementing a new feature for a data listing page. user: "I need to add functionality where users can view and filter a list of items by date range and category" main-agent: "Let me analyze the existing data patterns for this use case." <commentary> Since we're implementing a new feature, we should understand existing patterns first. Use the Task tool to launch the use-case-data-patterns agent to identify relevant data access patterns. </commentary> main-agent: "I'm going to use the use-case-data-patterns agent to examine how this use case maps to our current data architecture and identify any gaps." </example>

  <example> Context: Main agent is reviewing an API endpoint design for a checkout flow. user: "Can you explain how the checkout process works from the user's perspective?" main-agent: "Here's how the checkout flow works: [explanation]" <commentary> Now that we've explained the use case, use the use-case-data-patterns agent to map this to the actual data patterns in the codebase. </commentary> main-agent: "Let me use the use-case-data-patterns agent to show you how this use case is implemented in our data layer." </example>

  <example> Context: Main agent is planning refactoring work for an order processing system. user: "We need to support bulk orders where a user can submit multiple orders in a single transaction" main-agent: "I'll analyze the current data patterns to see how we can support this." <commentary> Before making changes, understand the existing patterns. Use the use-case-data-patterns agent to analyze current order processing data patterns. </commentary> main-agent: "I'm going to use the use-case-data-patterns agent to examine our current order data patterns and identify what needs to change." </example>
