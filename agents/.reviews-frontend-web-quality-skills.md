## ap-docs-guardian — Documentation Quality Review

### 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Value-First** | ✅ | Each section leads with "why": conditionals ("Engage only when…", "Websites only") answer "When should I use this?" |
| **Scannable** | ✅ | Tables for skills, bold for SEO/Usage conditionals, clear H3 "Frontend & Web Quality Skills" |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | ✅ | Table gives quick scan; Usage line gives next step; skill paths point to deep dives |
| **Problem-Oriented** | ✅ | Organized by "when to load" (problem) not by skill name alone; SEO explicitly scoped to websites |
| **Show, Don't Tell** | ✅ | Examples in Usage ("audit my site", "fix LCP", "improve accessibility"); negative examples ("not internal apps, dashboards, or API services") |
| **Connected** | ✅ | References link to all six skill SKILL.md files; same pattern across three agents |
| **Actionable** | ✅ | Usage line tells reader what to do (load web-quality-audit first vs specific skill; SEO only for websites) |

### Quality Gates

- **Structure:** Value proposition present (conditionals upfront). No ToC needed for these short sections.
- **Content:** Concrete examples (e.g. "not internal tools, CLI tools, data pipelines"). Benefits clear (avoid loading SEO for non-website work).
- **Scannability:** Tables and bold used consistently. No wall of text.
- **Navigation:** References section links to skill docs; path pattern `../skills/engineering-team/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` stated.
- **Accuracy:** Wording consistent across agents; only intentional variation is ap-code-reviewer's "during review" column vs "when to load" in the other two.

### Recommendations (Minor)

1. **Single source of truth:** The three agents repeat the same table and conditionals. If this block grows, consider a shared fragment or one canonical doc (e.g. in `skills/README.md` or `agents/README.md`) with "Frontend & Web Quality Skills" and link from each agent. Not required at current size.
2. **ap-frontend-engineer:** First line says "These skills apply only to **frontend and/or website** work." That's slightly redundant given the agent is frontend-only, but it reinforces the rule and clarifies SEO scope — **keep it**.
3. **Consistency:** ap-code-reviewer uses "Full-page or site-level review **of a website**"; ap-frontend-engineer/ap-fullstack-engineer use "Full site audit". Minor wording variance only; no change required unless you want exact copy.

### Verdict

Documentation meets the 7 pillars and quality gates. Conditionals (frontend/website only, SEO = websites only) are clear and actionable. No critical gaps.

## ap-progress-guardian — Progress & Traceability Review

### Document Status

| Document | Exists | Relevant to this work? |
|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| PLAN.md | ❌ Not in scope | N/A — agent doc updates, not feature implementation |
| WIP.md | ❌ Not in scope | N/A |
| LEARNINGS.md | ❌ Not in scope | N/A |

### Assessment

This work was **documentation and configuration updates** (agent frontmatter, new sections, conditionals, references). Progress Guardian’s usual PLAN/WIP/LEARNINGS flow applies to feature implementation, not to one-off doc edits.

**What was done (for traceability):**

- **ap-frontend-engineer:** Added 6 skills to `related-skills`; added "Frontend & Web Quality Skills" subsection with table and conditionals; added References links; clarified frontend/website-only and SEO = websites only.
- **ap-fullstack-engineer:** Same pattern; explicit "only when the work is frontend and/or website".
- **ap-code-reviewer:** Same 6 skills; "Engage only when the PR or codebase is frontend and/or website work"; SEO row and Usage line scoped to websites.

**Decisions captured in the docs:**

- Skills are engaged only for frontend and/or website work (not backend-only, API-only, or non-web).
- SEO is engaged only when the product is a website (pages intended for search indexing), not for internal apps, dashboards, or API services.

### Recommendations

1. **Changelog / ADR (optional):** If the repo maintains a CHANGELOG or agent-change log, add a short entry, e.g.  
   - "Agent docs: ap-frontend-engineer, ap-fullstack-engineer, ap-code-reviewer now reference frontend/web quality skills (accessibility, best-practices, core-web-vitals, performance, seo, web-quality-audit) with frontend/website-only and SEO-website-only conditions."
2. **Version / Last Updated:** Agent footers already have "Last Updated" (e.g. November 12, 2025). If you treat this as a release, bump or confirm date when merging.
3. **LEARNINGS.md:** Not required for this change set. If you want a durable record of "we scope SEO to websites only in agent docs", that could go in LEARNINGS.md for the current work and then be merged into CLAUDE.md or an ADR via ap-learn/ap-adr-writer; guardian recommends only if you use those workflows.

### Verdict

No PLAN/WIP/LEARNINGS needed for this documentation-only change. Decisions are documented in the agent files. Optional: add a CHANGELOG entry and/or refresh Last Updated for traceability.

---

**Summary:** ap-docs-guardian finds the documentation clear, consistent, and aligned with the 7 pillars; ap-progress-guardian finds progress/traceability adequate for a doc-only change and suggests optional CHANGELOG/date updates.
