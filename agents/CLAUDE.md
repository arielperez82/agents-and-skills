# Agent Development Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for creating **cs-* prefixed agents** that seamlessly integrate with the 42 production skills in this repository.

## Agent Architecture

### What are cs-* Agents?

**cs-* agents** are specialized Claude Code agents that orchestrate the 42 existing skills. Each agent:
- References skills via relative paths (`../../skills/marketing-team/`)
- Executes Python automation tools from skill packages
- Follows established workflows and templates
- Maintains skill portability and independence

**Key Principle**: Agents ORCHESTRATE skills, they don't replace them. Skills remain self-contained and portable.

## Agent Type Classification System

Agents are classified into four distinct types based on their operational characteristics, resource usage, and execution patterns:

| Type | Color | Tools | Execution | Process Count | Model | Examples |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| **Strategic** | 🔵 Blue | Read, Write, Grep | Parallel (4-5) | 15-20 | opus/sonnet | cs-product-director, cs-ceo-advisor, cs-ux-researcher |
| **Implementation** | 🟢 Green | Full tools | Coordinated (2-3) | 20-30 | sonnet | cs-fullstack, cs-backend-engineer, cs-frontend-engineer |
| **Quality** | 🔴 Red | Full + Heavy Bash | Sequential (1) | 12-18 | sonnet | cs-code-reviewer, cs-qa-engineer, cs-security-engineer |
| **Coordination** | 🟣 Purple | Read, Write, Grep | Lightweight | 10-15 | opus | cs-architect, cs-team-coordinator, cs-cto-advisor |

### Agent Type Details

#### Strategic Agents (Blue)
- **Purpose:** Planning, research, analysis, and strategic decision-making
- **Characteristics:** Read-heavy operations, no code execution, document generation
- **Resource Usage:** Low CPU, moderate memory, minimal I/O
- **Concurrency:** Safe to run 4-5 agents in parallel
- **Examples:** Product strategy, market analysis, UX research, business planning
- **Tools:** Primarily Read, Write, and Grep for knowledge extraction

#### Implementation Agents (Green)
- **Purpose:** Active code development, feature building, system implementation
- **Characteristics:** Full tool access, code generation, file modifications
- **Resource Usage:** Moderate CPU, high memory, high I/O
- **Concurrency:** Run 2-3 agents with coordination to avoid conflicts
- **Examples:** Frontend/backend development, API creation, database work
- **Tools:** Full toolset including Bash for builds and execution

#### Quality Agents (Red)
- **Purpose:** Testing, validation, code review, security scanning
- **Characteristics:** Heavy Bash operations, test runners, linting, scanning
- **Resource Usage:** High CPU, high memory, intensive I/O operations
- **Concurrency:** MUST run sequentially (1 at a time) to avoid resource contention
- **Examples:** Automated testing, security audits, performance profiling
- **Tools:** Full tools with extensive Bash for test execution

#### Coordination Agents (Purple)
- **Purpose:** Orchestrate other agents, manage workflows, delegate tasks
- **Characteristics:** Lightweight operations, workflow coordination, delegation
- **Resource Usage:** Low across all metrics
- **Concurrency:** Can run alongside other agents as they delegate work
- **Examples:** Architecture planning, team coordination, workflow management
- **Tools:** Limited toolset focused on reading and coordination

## Execution Safety Rules

### ✅ SAFE - Parallel Execution

**Strategic Agents in Parallel (4-5 agents max):**
```bash
# Safe to run together - low resource usage
cs-product-director &
cs-ux-researcher &
cs-ceo-advisor &
cs-product-marketer &
wait
```

**Why it's safe:** Strategic agents primarily read and analyze, with minimal resource contention.

### ✅ SAFE - Coordinated Execution

**Implementation Agents with Coordination (2-3 agents):**
```bash
# Frontend and backend development with coordination
cs-frontend-engineer --component user-dashboard &
cs-backend-engineer --api user-endpoints &
wait

# Ensure no file conflicts before continuing
cs-fullstack --integrate
```

**Why it's safe:** Limited concurrency with explicit coordination prevents file conflicts.

### ❌ UNSAFE - Never Do This

**Quality Agents in Parallel - SYSTEM CRASH RISK:**
```bash
# DANGEROUS - Will cause system overload
cs-qa-engineer --full-suite &
cs-code-reviewer --deep-analysis &
cs-security-engineer --full-scan &
# DON'T DO THIS - System will become unresponsive
```

**Why it's dangerous:** Quality agents spawn multiple sub-processes (test runners, linters, scanners) that quickly exhaust system resources.

### Process Count Monitoring

Monitor system load with this command:
```bash
ps aux | grep -E "mcp|npm|claude|python|node" | wc -l
```

**Safe Operating Ranges:**

| State | Process Count | Status | Action |
|-------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Idle | 6-10 | ✅ Normal | Ready for work |
| Strategic (4-5 agents) | 15-20 | ✅ Safe | Operating normally |
| Implementation (2-3 agents) | 20-30 | ✅ Safe | Monitor closely |
| Quality (1 agent) | 12-18 | ✅ Safe | Single agent only |
| Warning Zone | 30-40 | ⚠️ Warning | Complete current, avoid new |
| High Load | 40-60 | ⚠️ High | Stop non-critical agents |
| Critical | >60 | 🚫 Critical | Restart required |

**Emergency Recovery:**
```bash
# If system becomes unresponsive
killall -9 node python npm
# Restart Claude Code
```

## Model Selection by Agent Type

Choose the appropriate Claude model based on agent type and task complexity:

### Opus 4.5 (Recommended Default)
**When to use:** All tasks - same price as Sonnet but faster and better quality
- **Strengths:** Superior reasoning, faster execution, excellent code generation, nuanced understanding
- **Best for:** All agent tasks - strategic planning, code development, testing, review, general-purpose
- **Examples:**
  - All agents now default to `model: opus`
  - `cs-architect` - System design and patterns
  - `cs-fullstack-engineer` - Full application development
  - `cs-code-reviewer` - Code quality assessment

### Sonnet (Legacy Option)
**When to use:** Still valid, but Opus 4.5 is now preferred at same price point
- **Strengths:** Excellent code generation, reliable output
- **Best for:** If you need to specify Sonnet explicitly for compatibility
- **Note:** All agents have been updated to use Opus by default

### Haiku (Fast, Simple Tasks)
**When to use:** Simple, repetitive, or time-sensitive tasks where speed > depth
- **Strengths:** Very fast response, low resource usage, cost-effective
- **Best for:** Simple automation, data formatting, quick checks, commit messages
- **Examples:**
  - Simple git operations (branch cleanup, commit messages)
  - Quick status checks
  - Template-based documentation generation

## MCP Integration Patterns

Modern agents can leverage MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enhanced capabilities:

### Common MCP Servers

#### mcp__github
- **Purpose:** GitHub integration for PRs, issues, and code review
- **Use with:** `cs-code-reviewer`, `cs-qa-engineer`
- **Example:**
```bash
# Review PR with GitHub MCP
cs-code-reviewer --mcp github --pr 123
```

#### mcp__playwright
- **Purpose:** Browser automation, E2E testing, visual regression
- **Use with:** `cs-qa-engineer`, `cs-frontend-engineer`
- **Example:**
```bash
# Run E2E tests with screenshots
cs-qa-engineer --mcp playwright --test-suite e2e
```

#### mcp__context7
- **Purpose:** Documentation search and knowledge extraction
- **Use with:** `cs-tech-writer`, `cs-architect`
- **Example:**
```bash
# Search documentation
cs-tech-writer --mcp context7 --query "API patterns"
```

### MCP Best Practices

1. **Check MCP availability:** Not all environments have MCP servers
2. **Graceful fallback:** Agents should work without MCP when unavailable
3. **Resource awareness:** MCP servers add to process count
4. **Security:** MCP servers may require authentication tokens

### Agent vs Skill

| Aspect | Agent (cs-*) | Skill |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Orchestrate and execute workflows | Provide tools, knowledge, templates |
| **Location** | `agents/domain/` | `domain-skill/skill-name/` |
| **Structure** | Single .md file with YAML frontmatter | SKILL.md + scripts/ + references/ + assets/ |
| **Integration** | References skills via `../../` | Self-contained, no dependencies |
| **Naming** | cs-content-creator, cs-ceo-advisor | content-creator, ceo-advisor |

## Agent File Structure

### Required YAML Frontmatter (Website-Ready Format)

Every agent file uses a comprehensive 9-section YAML frontmatter structure:

**Section Overview:**
- **Core Identity**: Basic identification (name, title, description, domain)
- **Website Display**: User-facing information (difficulty, time-saved, use-cases)
- **Agent Classification**: Type system for resource management
- **Relationships**: Cross-references to other assets

### Agent Collaboration Pattern (collaborates-with)

The `collaborates-with` section defines optional dependencies between agents. This enables:
- **Website downloads**: Prompting users to download collaborator agents for full functionality
- **Feature discovery**: Showing what capabilities are unlocked with collaborators
- **Graceful degradation**: Clear communication of what works without collaborators

**Schema:**
```yaml
collaborates-with:
  - agent: cs-technical-writer          # Required: Agent name (must be cs-* prefixed)
    purpose: "Description of collaboration"  # Required: Why this collaboration exists
    required: optional                  # Optional: optional|recommended|required
    features-enabled: [feature-1, feature-2]  # Optional: Features unlocked
    without-collaborator: "What doesn't work"  # Optional: Degraded functionality
```

**Field Definitions:**
| Field | Required | Values | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `agent` | Yes | cs-* name | The collaborating agent identifier |
| `purpose` | Yes | string | Why this collaboration adds value |
| `required` | No | optional, recommended, required | Dependency strength |
| `features-enabled` | No | list | Specific features unlocked by collaborator |
| `without-collaborator` | No | string | What functionality is lost without collaborator |

**Examples:**

**Documentation Collaboration (optional):**
```yaml
collaborates-with:
  - agent: cs-technical-writer
    purpose: API documentation generation with sequence diagrams
    required: optional
    features-enabled: [api-docs, sequence-diagrams, architecture-diagrams]
    without-collaborator: "API documentation will be text-only without visual diagrams"
```

**Quality Collaboration (recommended):**
```yaml
collaborates-with:
  - agent: cs-qa-engineer
    purpose: Test strategy and quality assurance for backend services
    required: recommended
    features-enabled: [api-test-generation, integration-tests, load-testing]
    without-collaborator: "Backend code will lack comprehensive test coverage"
```

**Security Collaboration (recommended):**
```yaml
collaborates-with:
  - agent: cs-security-engineer
    purpose: Security review for authentication and API security patterns
    required: recommended
    features-enabled: [security-audit, auth-patterns, owasp-compliance]
    without-collaborator: "Security vulnerabilities may go undetected"
```

**Validation:**
The `agent_builder.py` validator checks:
- `agent` field is present and starts with `cs-`
- `purpose` field is present
- `required` is one of: optional, recommended, required
- `features-enabled` is a list or string
- `without-collaborator` is a string

### Required Markdown Sections

After YAML frontmatter, include these sections:

1. **Purpose** (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Skill Integration** (with subsections)
   - Skill Location
   - Python Tools
   - Knowledge Bases
   - Templates
3. **Workflows** (minimum 3 workflows)
4. **Integration Examples** (concrete code/command examples)
5. **Success Metrics** (how to measure effectiveness)
6. **Related Agents** (cross-references)
7. **References** (links to documentation)

## Relative Path Resolution

### Path Pattern

All skill references use the `../../` pattern:

```markdown
**Skill Location:** `../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/`

### Python Tools

1. **Brand Voice Analyzer**
   - **Path:** `../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py`
   - **Usage:** `python ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py content.txt`

2. **SEO Optimizer**
   - **Path:** `../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/seo_optimizer.py`
   - **Usage:** `python ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/seo_optimizer.py article.md "keyword"`
```

### Why `../../`?

From agent location: `agents/marketing/cs-content-creator.md`
To skill location: `marketing-skill/content-creator/`

Navigation: `agents/marketing/` → `../../` (up to root) → `marketing-skill/content-creator/`

**Always test paths resolve correctly!**

## Python Tool Integration

### Execution Pattern

Agents execute Python tools from skill packages:

```bash
# From agent context
python ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py input.txt

# With JSON output
python ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py input.txt json

# With arguments
python ../../skills/product-team/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/rice_prioritizer.py features.csv --capacity 20
```

### Tool Requirements

All Python tools must:
- Use standard library only (or minimal dependencies documented in SKILL.md)
- Support both JSON and human-readable output
- Provide `--help` flag with usage information
- Return appropriate exit codes (0 = success, 1 = error)
- Handle missing arguments gracefully

### Error Handling

When Python tools fail:
1. Check file path resolution
2. Verify input file exists
3. Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)
4. Review tool's `--help` output
5. Inspect error messages in stderr

## Workflow Documentation

### Workflow Structure

Each workflow must include:

```markdown
### Workflow 1: [Clear Descriptive Name]

**Goal:** One-sentence description

**Steps:**
1. **[Action]** - Description with specific commands/tools
2. **[Action]** - Description with specific commands/tools
3. **[Action]** - Description with specific commands/tools

**Expected Output:** What success looks like

**Time Estimate:** How long this workflow takes

**Example:**
\`\`\`bash
# Concrete example command
python ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/seo_optimizer.py article.md "primary keyword"
\`\`\`
```

### Minimum Requirements

Each agent must document **at least 3 workflows** covering:
1. Primary use case (most common scenario)
2. Advanced use case (complex scenario)
3. Integration use case (combining multiple tools)

## Agent Template

Use this template when creating new agents:

```markdown
---
name: cs-agent-name
description: One-line description
skills: skill-folder-name
domain: domain-name
model: sonnet
tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob]
---

- [ ] All required fields present (name, description, skills, domain, model, tools)
- [ ] cs-* prefix used for agent naming
- [ ] Relative paths resolve correctly (../../ pattern)
- [ ] Skill location documented and accessible
- [ ] Python tools referenced with correct paths
- [ ] At least 3 workflows documented
- [ ] Integration examples provided and tested
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Related agents cross-referenced

### Testing Agent Integration

Test these aspects:

**1. Path Resolution**
```bash
# From agent directory
cd agents/marketing/
ls ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/  # Should list contents
```

**2. Python Tool Execution**
```bash
# Create test input
echo "Test content" > test-input.txt

# Execute tool
python ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py test-input.txt

# Verify output
```

**3. Knowledge Base Access**
```bash
# Verify reference files exist
cat ../../skills/marketing-team/content-creator/references/brand_guidelines.md
```

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### Marketing Agents (agents/marketing/)
- Focus on content creation, SEO, demand generation
- Reference: `../../skills/marketing-team/`
- Tools: brand_voice_analyzer.py, seo_optimizer.py

### Product Agents (agents/product/)
- Focus on prioritization, user research, agile workflows
- Reference: `../../skills/product-team/`
- Tools: rice_prioritizer.py, user_story_generator.py, okr_cascade_generator.py

### C-Level Agents (agents/c-level/)
- Focus on strategic decision-making
- Reference: `../../c-level-advisor/`
- Tools: Strategic analysis and planning tools

### Engineering Agents (agents/engineering/)
- Focus on scaffolding, code quality, fullstack development
- Reference: `../../skills/engineering-team/`
- Tools: project_scaffolder.py, code_quality_analyzer.py

## Common Pitfalls

**Avoid these mistakes:**

❌ Hardcoding absolute paths
❌ Skipping YAML frontmatter validation
❌ Forgetting to test relative paths
❌ Documenting workflows without examples
❌ Creating agent dependencies (keep them independent)
❌ Duplicating skill content in agent files
❌ Using LLM calls instead of referencing Python tools

## Agent Design Principles & Learnings

These principles are derived from systematic analysis of agent overlap, collaboration patterns, and refactoring efforts across the agent ecosystem.

### 1. Separate Agents by Job-to-Be-Done, Not Implementation Method

**Principle:** Agents should be distinguished by their **purpose and output**, not by how they achieve it.

**Good Separation:**
- ✅ Same domain, different **purpose/output**: `cs-architect` (designs "what"), `cs-implementation-planner` (plans "how"), `cs-adr-writer` (documents "why")
- ✅ Different abstraction levels: `cs-tdd-guardian` (methodology) vs `cs-tpp-guardian` (strategy)

**Bad Separation:**
- ❌ Same purpose/output, different **implementation method**: `scout` vs `scout-external` → should merge
- ❌ Same responsibility, different tools → creates coordination overhead

**Example:** `cs-researcher` is the single source for external research. `cs-implementation-planner` and `cs-brainstormer` should **consume** researcher reports, not do web searches directly.

### 2. Default to Delegation Graph with Clear Single-Owners

**Principle:** Establish clear ownership and consumption patterns to avoid duplication.

**Patterns:**
- **Single source for external research**: Planner/Brainstormer consume researcher reports
- **Single source for tactical TDD guidance**: Strategic planner delegates to `cs-tpp-guardian` (test ordering), `cs-tdd-guardian` (methodology), `cs-progress-guardian` (tracking)
- **Security split**: Coach/guardian (`cs-security-engineer`) + unified DevSecOps owner (`cs-devsecops-engineer`) + incident specialist (`cs-incident-responder`)

**Implementation:**
- Document **who produces** which artifact
- Document **who consumes** it
- Document **when** the handoff occurs
- Make delegation explicit in `collaborates-with` sections

### 3. Guardian/Validator Roles Are Non-Implementers

**Principle:** Some agents should **assess, guide, and validate** but **never implement**.

**Guardian Pattern:**
- **Proactive**: Provide guidance before implementation
- **Reactive**: Validate and review after implementation
- **Output**: Prioritized findings (🔴 Critical → ⚠️ High Priority → 💡 Nice to Have)
- **Timing**: Document "when to invoke" (before vs after)

**Examples:**
- `cs-tdd-guardian`: TDD methodology coaching (doesn't write code)
- `cs-docs-guardian`: Documentation quality review (doesn't write docs)
- `cs-progress-guardian`: Progress tracking validation (doesn't create plans)
- `cs-refactor-guardian`: Refactoring opportunity assessment (doesn't refactor code)

**Key Insight:** Implementers should **ask guardians FIRST** when planning work, and **ask guardians AFTER** when work is complete.

### 4. Overlap Detection: Function + Output + Timing

**Principle:** Use a systematic rubric to identify problematic overlap.

**High-Risk Overlap (Merge Candidates):**
- Same user prompts/use cases
- Same outputs/artifacts
- Same invocation timing
- **Result:** Usually merge or re-scope

**Acceptable Overlap (Keep Separate):**
- Different abstraction levels (methodology vs strategy)
- Different scope boundaries (cross-cutting vs team-specific)
- Different deliverables (plan vs ADR vs review report)
- **Result:** Complementary, not duplicative

**Example:** `cs-tdd-guardian` (TDD methodology) and `cs-tpp-guardian` (TPP strategy) both relate to TDD but serve different purposes at different abstraction levels.

### 5. Refactoring Agents: Five Levers for Crispness

**Principle:** Use these five mechanisms to improve agent clarity and reduce overlap.

**1. Rename + Relocate**
- Use `cs-*` prefix consistently
- Team folders for team-specific roles (`engineering/`, `product/`, `delivery/`)
- Root directory for cross-cutting concerns (`cs-docs-guardian.md`)

**2. Tighten Descriptions**
- Remove stray responsibilities (e.g., "research" creeping into non-research agents)
- Focus on core job-to-be-done
- Remove implementation details that belong in skills

**3. Declare Orchestration Explicitly**
- If agent "owns" a skill, include `orchestrates:` section
- Makes skill ownership clear and discoverable
- Required for consistency across engineering agents

**4. Bidirectional Relationships**
- If A collaborates with B, B should list A in `related-agents`
- Improves discoverability
- Prevents "one-way" ecosystem drift

**5. Document Handoffs as Protocols**
- Who produces which artifact
- Who consumes it
- At what step in the workflow
- Make it a protocol, not a suggestion

### 6. Merge vs Keep Separate: Decision Rule

**Principle:** Use a simple heuristic to decide when to merge agents.

**Merge When:**
- ~80-100% overlap on purpose + output (e.g., `scout` vs `scout-external`)
- Role boundaries create coordination cost without adding specialization
- Same user need, different implementation method

**Keep Separate When:**
- Different stages in a pipeline (research → debate → architecture → plan)
- One is coach/guardian, other is implementer
- Different abstraction levels (strategic vs tactical)
- Different scope boundaries (cross-cutting vs team-specific)

**Example:** `cs-implementation-planner` (strategic) stays separate from `cs-tpp-guardian` (tactical TDD) because they serve different stages and abstraction levels.

### 7. Collaboration Contracts > More Agents

**Principle:** Explicit collaboration protocols reduce need for additional agents.

**Best Practices:**
- Document **who calls whom** and **when**
- Remove duplicate capabilities in favor of **consuming outputs**
- Make collaboration explicit in `collaborates-with` sections
- Use `required: optional|recommended|required` to indicate dependency strength

**Example:** Instead of giving `cs-implementation-planner` research capabilities, document that it should consume `cs-researcher` reports. This creates cleaner separation and better reuse.

### Agent Design Checklist

Before creating or refactoring an agent, verify:

- [ ] **Purpose clarity**: Can you state the agent's job-to-be-done in one sentence?
- [ ] **Output uniqueness**: Does this agent produce artifacts that no other agent produces?
- [ ] **Delegation pattern**: If this agent needs research/planning/validation, does it delegate to specialized agents?
- [ ] **Guardian vs implementer**: Is this agent a guardian (assesses/validates) or implementer (creates/modifies)?
- [ ] **Orchestration declared**: If this agent owns a skill, is `orchestrates:` section present?
- [ ] **Bidirectional relationships**: If A collaborates with B, does B list A in `related-agents`?
- [ ] **Overlap check**: Does this agent overlap >80% with another agent on purpose + output + timing?
- [ ] **Collaboration documented**: Are handoff protocols clearly documented in `collaborates-with` sections?

## Next Steps

After creating an agent:

1. Test all relative paths resolve
2. Execute all Python tools from agent context
3. Verify all workflows with concrete examples
4. Update agent catalog in main README.md
5. Create GitHub issue for agent testing
6. Commit with conventional commit message: `feat(agents): implement cs-agent-name`
