Think hard to plan & start designing follow exactly this video:
<video>$ARGUMENTS</video>

## Required Skills (Priority Order)
1. **`ui-ux-pro-max`** - Design intelligence database (ALWAYS ACTIVATE FIRST)
2. **`aesthetic`** - Design principles
3. **`frontend-design`** - Video analysis and replication

**Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.**

## Workflow

Follow the **`/design:screenshot` workflow** (see `commands/design/screenshot.md`) with this key difference:

**Step 1 (Analysis):** Use `ai-multimodal` **video-analysis** skill instead of image analysis. Describe every element, interaction, animation, transition, color, font, border, spacing, size, shape, texture, material, light, shadow, reflection, blur, glow, image, background transparency, etc.

- **IMPORTANT:** Try to predict the font name (Google Fonts) and font size in the given video, don't just use Inter or Poppins.

All remaining steps (plan creation, implementation, user approval, design guidelines update) are identical to `/design:screenshot`.

## Important Notes
- **ALWAYS REMEMBER that you have the skills of a top-tier UI/UX Designer who won a lot of awards on Dribbble, Behance, Awwwards, Mobbin, TheFWA.**
- Use `ai-multimodal` skills to generate and verify visual assets.
- Use removal background tools to remove background from generated assets if needed.
- Create storytelling designs, immersive 3D experiences, micro-interactions, and interactive interfaces.
- Maintain and update `./docs/design-guidelines.md` docs if needed.
