## tl;dr

The traditional model of fixed development teams and rigid roadmaps hinders innovation in an experiment-driven product environment. To truly embrace agility and respond to the unpredictable nature of discovery, we need **dynamic resourcing**.

**Key takeaways:**
- Embrace shorter-range, probabilistic resource planning that aligns with the evolving nature of experimentation
- Build a mix of core and flexible resources to scale capacity up or down as needed

**Actionable steps:**
- Invest in strong product management to drive effective discovery and experimentation
- Create core teams with flexible "halos" of external or internal resources
- Split development into different types with varying degrees of flexibility
- Ensure backlogs of valuable tasks for underutilized resources
- Foster a culture of internal mobility to encourage flexibility and knowledge sharing

## The Paradox of Experimentation

In the perfect vision of experimental product management, we begin with a product vision and strategy and synthesize this with customer listening and research to generate many ideas. We then take each through iterative and progressive forms of discovery, validation, and experimentation.

This iterative process ensures that what we build will actually deliver value, investing resources only in what really matters. Much like a scientist who starts with a theory, we gradually test to refine and invest more time and resources only as we become more confident.

Many ideas that seem compelling will be proven fruitless. Conversely, things that seem weak often develop into highly successful ideas.

## The Roadmap Problem

This completely destroys the traditional notion of the "roadmap." While it is possible to plan strategic themes and business questions to guide discovery work, the idea that a year's worth of large "features" can be nicely scoped and time-boxed makes no sense.

The fact that a roadmap exists at all in a digital product environment is often a clear indication it has been unable to shake free from waterfall.

## The Resource Allocation Conundrum

The process of experimentation and discovery is inherently unpredictable in terms of what it will produce. Yet we mostly have fixed teams that need to be kept busy. This leads to a downward spiral:

1. Big vanity projects created to keep resources busy
2. Projects mutate and grow in complexity
3. Resources pulled away from actual innovation work
4. Innovation fizzles out
5. New vanity project needed

## Building a Dynamic Resourcing Model

Two things needed:
1. **Shorter-range resource planning/forecasting** which is probabilistic in nature
2. **Resources which can be easily flexed** around those shorter terms

### Probabilistic Resource Planning

Like a sales pipeline: individual opportunities sized in terms of revenue and resources needed, with a degree of confidence against them. This sizing and confidence calculates likely upper and lower levels of required resources.

As long as you track individual steps within broader ideas (including projected future steps, sizing, timing, and confidence), you can project a what-if scenario for an upcoming month or quarter.

### Flexible Resources

Approaches to create flexibility:

- **Invest in effective product management:** The most vital starting point. Requires critical thinking, advanced organization skills, experienced support adept with data, research, and experimentation.

- **Core teams with flexible halos:** Minimally sized but senior and highly proficient core teams, augmented with flexible resources as larger projects demand. Core teams must be adept at managing/mentoring flexible resources.

- **Split development into types:** Critical maintenance/support (easy to forecast, keep constant). Product discovery/experimentation (control via velocity metrics). Large involved development (needs greater allowance for flexibility).

- **Variety of flexible resources:** External agency partners, individual freelancers, or internal flexible task force of multi-skilled resources who drop in/out of core teams as needed. Culture of internal mobility.

- **Backlogs for underutilized resources:** Technical debt, bug fixing, documentation, developer-experience tasks. Must be easily pausable or quick to complete. Avoids vanity projects that block flexibility.

## Relevance to Prioritization

Experimental PM reframes the prioritization question from "what features should we build?" to "how should we allocate capacity across discovery, validation, and delivery?" This connects to portfolio allocation by adding a temporal dimension: items at different stages of validation deserve different resource commitment levels.
