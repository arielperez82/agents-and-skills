# Prioritization Framework Selection Guide (Intake Reference)

When to use which framework. Source: PM skills intake (I11-PMSI); sandbox `prioritization-advisor`.

## Purpose

Match prioritization frameworks to product stage, team context, decision-making needs, and data availability—avoid "framework whiplash" or applying the wrong framework (e.g. RICE for strategic bets, ICE for data-driven decisions).

## Framework Landscape

**Scoring frameworks**

- **RICE** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) — Data-driven, requires metrics
- **ICE** (Impact, Confidence, Ease) — Lightweight, gut-check scoring
- **Value vs. Effort** (2×2) — Quick wins vs. strategic bets
- **Weighted Scoring** — Custom criteria with stakeholder input

**Strategic frameworks**

- **Kano Model** — Classify by customer delight (basic, performance, delight)
- **Opportunity Scoring** — Importance vs. satisfaction gap
- **MoSCoW** (Must, Should, Could, Won't) — Forcing function for hard choices

**Contextual frameworks**

- **Cost of Delay** — Urgency-based, time-sensitive features
- **Impact Mapping** — Goal-driven, tie features to outcomes
- **Story Mapping** — User journey-based, narrative flow

## Selection Drivers

| Driver | Lean toward |
|--------|--------------|
| Pre-PMF, high uncertainty | Lightweight, speed (ICE, Value vs. Effort) |
| Early PMF, scaling | Balance speed and data (RICE, Opportunity Scoring) |
| Mature product | Data-driven (RICE, NPV, portfolio allocation) |
| Portfolio / multiple products | Portfolio allocation + within-bucket (this skill’s primary approach) |
| Stakeholders misaligned | Transparent scoring, consensus (Weighted Scoring, MoSCoW) |
| Minimal data | Gut-based (ICE, Value vs. Effort, Kano) |
| Rich data | RICE, NPV, Cost of Delay |

## Integration with This Skill

This skill’s **primary approach** is portfolio allocation + NPV-based within-bucket prioritization. Use this selection guide when:

- Choosing or revisiting the right framework for your context
- Onboarding PMs to team practices
- Aligning stakeholders on process

For portfolio-level allocation and within-bucket ranking, use the main SKILL workflows and [portfolio-allocation-framework.md](portfolio-allocation-framework.md). For one-off or lightweight decisions, consider ICE or Value vs. Effort per this guide.
