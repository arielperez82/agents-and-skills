In _Transformed_, Marty Cagan introduces _The Product Operating Model_ (POM): "How the best tech-powered companies work — principles, practices, and competencies."

## The Direction of Change

Imagine a spectrum of companies. On the left: the fully "traditional" product company (top-down leadership, revenue focus, delivery teams doing the bidding of the business). On the right: the fully "modern" company using the Product Operating Model (customer-focused, empowering, evidence-guided). Both extremes are abstractions, but they describe the direction of change.

Your company is somewhere on this spectrum. Modernizing the operating model is evolution — working steadily to become a better version, not attempting to copy someone else's playbook.

## Eight Functions of a Tech-Powered Organization

A useful system model breaks tech-powered organizations into eight cross-disciplinary, cross-rank functions:

1. **Strategic Context**
2. **Goals and Metrics**
3. **Research**
4. **Product Discovery**
5. **Product Delivery**
6. **Go-To-Market**
7. **Operations and Infrastructure**
8. **Culture**

Each function is a sub-system with its own processes and outcomes. They are co-dependent, but each can be improved independently.

### Traditional vs. Modern: Key Differences

| Function | Traditional | Modern (POM) |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Strategic Context | Mission = business success; strategy = wish list of pillars; multi-year plans that never materialize | Vision of better future; mission states company's role; strategy specifies top opportunities; agile and evidence-guided |
| Research | Collecting customer requests; casual competitive monitoring | Broad spectrum: user interviews, market monitoring, data analysis, technology experiments; accessible to all levels |
| Goals and Metrics | Business metrics only (revenue, profit); output-focused | Business + customer value + product health + company health; outcome over output; outcome roadmaps |
| Product Discovery | No formal concept; ideas chosen by opinion/consensus/rank; late-stage MVP changes nothing | Ideas are hypotheses; time spent evaluating before committing; willing to dump/pivot ideas that don't work |
| Product Delivery | Elaborate Agile rituals; expectation of full scope on time; perfect specifications; possibly SAFe | Lax about rituals; PM/eng/UX collaboration on details; right things > sprint goals |
| Go-To-Market | Marketing/sales work off predefined roadmap; friction when product slips | Cross-functional collaboration; growth teams; continuous effort to deliver value |
| Operations | Minimize costs, reduce risks, enforce policy — even at cost of slowing innovation | Optimize for serving internal customers; evidence-guided internal product model |
| Culture | Centralized decisions; role-based hiring; managers enforce; mistrust grows with size | Delegated decisions; culture-fit hiring; managers coach; trust by default; balance business/user/engineering needs |

## The Unthinking Robot

The traditionally-operated tech company suffers from acute imbalance: everything to do with execution (Delivery, Go-to-market, Operations) is bloated and takes most resources, while observation and thinking (Research, Discovery, Strategic Context) are severely underdeveloped.

Like a robot with strong limbs but weak software — potential to do a lot, but disoriented and uncoordinated.

## Relevance to Prioritization

When prioritization process itself feels broken, POM provides a diagnostic framework:
- Is Strategic Context clear enough to drive bucket allocations?
- Are Goals outcome-focused or output-focused?
- Does Research inform prioritization or is it absent?
- Is there Product Discovery, or are ideas committed without validation?
- Is Culture blocking honest trade-off conversations?

Use POM assessment to identify which organizational function is the bottleneck before layering more process on top.
