Product Strategy is hard. For most tech companies their first big product success is also their last. Finding a second hit is very hard no matter how much we invest in vision and strategy development. The core business somehow always generates 90%+ of revenue and engagement.

But some companies are different. Consider these magical product sequences:

- Apple: iPod -> iPhone -> iPad
- Amazon: Book store -> Everything store -> Marketplace
- Netflix: Mail-order DVDs -> Video streaming -> Originals
- Google: Search -> AdWords -> Gmail -> Chrome -> Android
- Tesla: Roadster -> Model S -> Model X -> Model 3

How do they do it?

## It Ain't Necessarily So

If you dig deeper, you find that the backstory is far more convoluted and messy than we were made to believe. Luck is always a major component in success, and the progression is rarely (if ever) Vision -> Strategy -> Product.

Great vision and strategy are good stories written in hindsight.

### The iPhone Case Study

Far from being a result of a premeditated strategy, the iPhone was a case of multiple strategic initiatives converging to create a perfect storm:

- **Multi-touch (2002):** Self-appointed group of Apple designers discovered nascent multi-touch technology. Project Q79 created then canceled due to cost.
- **Motorola Rockr e1 (2004):** Defensive partnership — phone with limited iPod functionality. Slow, clunky, didn't sell. But forged the AT&T relationship.
- **AT&T partnership:** AT&T willing to give Apple free hand in designing its future phone in exchange for exclusivity. Removed the carrier-meddling obstacle.
- **iPod phone (P1):** iPod team started stealth project — gutted iPod with radio transceivers. Click-wheel interface.
- **Multi-touch phone (P2):** Jobs challenged ex-Q79 team to design a multi-touch phone. Pitted P1 vs P2 in a race. Multi-touch won.
- **The iPhone:** P2 software team convinced Jobs to equip device with miniaturized Mac OS X (later iOS). Turned phone into mobile computing device.

Apple found the vision and strategy for the iPhone through trial and error. The process was as much bottom-up as top-down. Steve Jobs was an opportunistic leader willing to test strategic ideas, shut down the ones that didn't work, and push further the ones that did.

## MuST Principle

Whether intentionally or not, great companies arrive at their product strategies through parallel explorations — **strategic tracks**. Each strategic track tests a big idea (new product, new business model, etc.) by building short/medium-size projects. The goal is as much discovery as validation.

MuST is the opposite of classic plan-and-execute strategy development:
- Not about information gathering, analysis, and careful planning
- Doesn't necessarily follow one overarching, immutable vision — vision evolves
- Not conceived in an executive boardroom and handed down
- Not the brainchild of one super-visionary person

> Testing multiple strategic ideas improves the odds of finding the next big thing.

## Examples

### Google's Early Product Strategy: Creating Optionality

Google made heavy use of the principle of optionality. Each track gave Google technology, code, inventions, market footprint, learnings, customer and partner relationships, at relatively small cost. By 2005 Google had the option to enter Messaging, Geo, Media, Social and more. Some options it exercised, while others (like social networking via Orkut) it passed on.

### Microsoft: Capitalizing on Strategic Opportunities

Gates and Allen chose to acquire QDOS rights and evolve it into PC-DOS for IBM rather than either rejecting the offer or pivoting entirely. Hidden in the agreement was a clause allowing Microsoft to resell the software. When dozens of IBM-PC clones emerged, they all licensed from Microsoft.

### Netflix: Systemizing MuST

Netflix creates "swimlanes" to test strategic hypotheses. Each swimlane has a team testing one strategic idea by building a series of tactical projects and experiments and measuring them against predefined metrics. At any given point Netflix has between 2 and 10 independent swimlanes.

Periodically management adjusts: close tracks that didn't lead to meaningful results, open new ones, adjust funding for existing tracks per results.

## The Anti-pattern: Big-Bet Projects

The phenomenal success of the iPhone made everyone want to copy Apple's playbook. The wrong lessons were learned. Strategic hypotheses were turned into white elephant projects with little or no validation. Result: Google+, Google Glass, Facebook VR, Facebook Chatbots, Amazon Fire phone.

## Applying MuST

Any company that already found its first success should be laying out strategic tracks for the next big thing. With today's rapid development and quick iteration methods, MuST is no longer the prerogative of large companies.

Key practices:
- Run 2-10 parallel strategic tracks
- Each track has defined kill criteria and metrics
- Tracks can overlap and even be mutually exclusive
- Periodically review: close underperformers, open new tracks, adjust funding
- Strategy emerges from the tracks — don't force all tracks into one pre-defined vision
