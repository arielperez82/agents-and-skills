# Company Research for Competitive Intelligence (Intake Reference)

Comprehensive company profiling for competitive and strategic context. Source: PM skills intake (I11-PMSI); sandbox `company-research`.

## Purpose

Extract executive insights, product strategy, transformation initiatives, and organizational dynamics from publicly available sources to understand competitive landscape, partnerships, or market entry.

## Executive Insights Framework

1. **Company Overview** — Basic info, history, industry context
2. **Executive Quotes** — Strategic vision from CEO, COO, VP Product, Group PM
3. **Product Insights** — Strategy, recent launches, innovation focus
4. **Transformation Strategies** — Digital, AI, Agile transformations
5. **Organizational Impact** — How PM influences strategy, cross-functional collaboration
6. **Future Roadmap** — Upcoming initiatives and anticipated challenges
7. **Product-Led Growth** — PLG strategies, data-driven decisions

## When to Use

- Competitive analysis (how competitors approach PM and product)
- Partnership evaluation (cultural fit, strategic direction)
- Interview preparation (company culture, product philosophy)
- Benchmarking and market entry decisions

## When Not to Use

- Internal analysis (this is external research)
- When primary sources are unavailable
- As a substitute for customer research (company perspective, not customer)

## Integration with This Skill

Feed company research into scorecard generation and gap analysis: use executive and product insights to interpret competitor capabilities and positioning before running `competitive_analyzer.py` or `gap_analyzer.py`.
