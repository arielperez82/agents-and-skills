# PESTEL Analysis for Strategic Context (Intake Reference)

Macro-environmental analysis to inform strategy and risk. Source: PM skills intake (I11-PMSI); sandbox `pestel-analysis`.

## Purpose

Systematic analysis of Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors that could impact your product or project—identifying external opportunities and threats and informing strategic planning and market entry.

## PESTEL Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Political** | Government policies, stability, trade regulations, taxation |
| **Economic** | Growth rates, inflation, exchange rates, consumer spending |
| **Social** | Demographics, cultural trends, lifestyle changes, consumer attitudes |
| **Technological** | Advancements, R&D, automation, digital transformation |
| **Environmental** | Climate change, sustainability, resource scarcity, regulations |
| **Legal** | Compliance, IP rights, employment laws, health/safety |

## When to Use

- Entering a new market or geography
- Strategic planning (annual roadmapping, 3–5 year planning)
- Assessing product viability in a changing environment
- Risk assessment for new initiatives; pitching to execs or investors

## When Not to Use

- Tactical, short-term decisions (use competitive analysis instead)
- When external factors are stable and well-understood
- As a substitute for customer research (PESTEL is macro, not micro)

## Integration with This Skill

Use PESTEL to set context before competitive scorecards: macro forces explain why competitors or your own positioning may shift. Complements gap analysis and adoption prioritization by adding environmental risk and opportunity.
