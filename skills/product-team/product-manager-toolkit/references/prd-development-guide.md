# PRD Development Guide (Intake Reference)

Structured PRD creation from problem framing through success criteria. Source: PM skills intake (I11-PMSI); sandbox `prd-development`.

## Purpose

Move from scattered notes to a clear PRD that aligns stakeholders, provides engineering context, and serves as source of truth—avoiding ambiguity and scope creep.

## PRD Core Questions

1. **What problem are we solving?** (Problem statement)
2. **For whom?** (Target users/personas)
3. **Why now?** (Strategic context, business case)
4. **What are we building?** (Solution overview)
5. **How will we measure success?** (Metrics, success criteria)
6. **What are the requirements?** (User stories, acceptance criteria, constraints)
7. **What are we NOT building?** (Out of scope)

## Standard PRD Structure

- Executive Summary (one paragraph: problem + solution + impact)
- Problem Statement (who, what, why, evidence)
- Target Users & Personas (primary/secondary, jobs-to-be-done)
- Strategic Context (OKRs, market opportunity, competitive landscape, why now)
- Solution Overview (description, user flows, key features)
- Success Metrics (primary/secondary, targets)
- User Stories & Requirements (epic hypothesis, acceptance criteria, edge cases)
- Out of Scope (explicit exclusions)
- Dependencies & Risks (technical, external, mitigations)
- Open Questions (unresolved decisions, discovery areas)

## Integration with This Toolkit

- Use discovery outputs (Mom Test, opportunity scoring) to ground Problem Statement and Target Users.
- Use [templates.md](templates.md) for Standard, One-Page, Feature Brief, and Agile Epic formats.
- Use [frameworks.md](frameworks.md) for prioritization and success-metric patterns.
