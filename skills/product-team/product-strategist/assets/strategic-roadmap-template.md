# Roadmap: <project-name>

Evergreen project-level roadmap. Maintained by product-director. Sequences all initiatives by horizon (Now / Next / Later / Done). When a new charter arrives, the product-director evaluates it against this roadmap and slots it into the appropriate horizon.

**Authority:** This roadmap is authority for **sequencing between initiatives**. Charters are authority for **scope within an initiative**. Backlogs are authority for **execution order**. Plans are authority for **how to build**.

## Now

Initiatives actively in progress.

| Initiative | Name | Description | Status | Charter |
|------------|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| I<nn>-<ACRO> | <name> | <brief description> | <status> | [charter](<path>) |

## Next

Initiatives chartered and ready to start when capacity allows.

| Initiative | Name | Description | Charter |
