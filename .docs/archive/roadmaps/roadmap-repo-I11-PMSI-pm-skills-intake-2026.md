# Roadmap: PM Skills Intake (2026)

## Outcomes (sequenced)

| Order | Outcome | Checkpoint |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Complete PM skill intake waves for new and adapted product-team skills | `skills/product-team/saas-finance/`, `skills/product-team/continuous-discovery/`, `skills/product-team/workshop-facilitation/`, plus updated `agile-product-owner` and `product-strategist` |
| 2 | Complete remaining adaptation wave for PM toolkit, competitive analysis, and prioritization references | Updated `skills/product-team/product-manager-toolkit/`, `skills/product-team/competitive-analysis/`, `skills/product-team/prioritization-frameworks/` |
| 3 | Synchronize catalogs and close initiative | Updated `skills/product-team/CLAUDE.md`, updated `skills/README.md`, verification checklist complete |

## Parallelization notes

- Outcome 1 split into Wave 1 (B01-B02) and Wave 2 (B03-B05).
- Outcome 2 executes as Wave 3 (B06-B08) with independent adaptations.
- Outcome 3 executes post-wave as B09-B10 after content work is complete.

## Outcome validation

| Outcome | Validation | Pass criteria |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Filesystem and SKILL frontmatter checks | Added/updated skills and references match backlog definitions |
| 2 | Reference wiring checks | New references are present and listed under `dependencies.references` |
| 3 | Catalog consistency checks | Team and global catalogs reflect newly added skills and final counts |
