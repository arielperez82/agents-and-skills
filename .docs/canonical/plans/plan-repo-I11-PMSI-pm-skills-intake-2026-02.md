# Plan: PM Skills Intake (I11-PMSI)

Incorporate PM skill content into `skills/product-team/` via wave-based add/adapt operations. **Source:** Content was developed from `.claude/skills/_sandbox/product-manager-skills/source/` (or an equivalent clone of [Product-Manager-Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)); if the sandbox is removed, use that repo for Wave 3 (B06–B08) reference material.

## Immediate Remaining Work

1. Complete Wave 3 (`B06-B08`) across product-team skills.
2. Update catalogs (`B09-B10`) to reflect new PM skills.
3. Run verification checklist and mark initiative complete.
