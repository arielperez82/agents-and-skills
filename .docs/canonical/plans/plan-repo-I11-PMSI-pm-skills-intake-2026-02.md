# Plan: PM Skills Intake (I11-PMSI)

Incorporate PM skill content into `skills/product-team/` via wave-based add/adapt operations. **Source:** Content was developed from `.claude/skills/_sandbox/product-manager-skills/source/` (or an equivalent clone of [Product-Manager-Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)); if the sandbox is removed, use that repo for Wave 3 (B06–B08) reference material.
