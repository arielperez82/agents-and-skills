# Roadmap: Shell Script Linting (I09-SHSL) — 2026

Single outcome: shell-scripting skill + Phase 0 conditional + this repo wired for ShellCheck (pre-commit + CI).

## Outcome 1: Skill, Phase 0 conditional, and repo gate

**Goal:** Agents and teams know when/how to run ShellCheck; Phase 0 checklist includes conditional shell lint; this repo runs ShellCheck on commit and in CI.

**Backlog items:** B1 (skill), B2 (quality-gate-first update), B3 (pre-commit), B4 (CI), B5 (catalog/references).

**Parallelization:** B1 and B2 can run in parallel. B3 and B4 (devsecops) depend on B1 (skill documents the pattern). B5 after B1–B4.
