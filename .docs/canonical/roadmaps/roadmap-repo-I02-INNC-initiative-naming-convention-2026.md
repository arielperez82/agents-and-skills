# Roadmap: Initiative Naming and Traceability Convention (2026)

## Outcomes (sequenced)

| Order | Outcome | Checkpoint |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Charter and AGENTS.md encode initiative naming (ID grammar, required front matter, References by initiative) | Charter published; AGENTS.md has initiative-naming section and References (by initiative) |
| 2 | Existing canonical docs (I01-ACM) retrofitted with initiative + initiative_name; AGENTS.md references use I01-ACM | All roadmap/backlog/plan for artifact-conventions-migration have initiative: I01-ACM, initiative_name; AGENTS.md lists I01-ACM |
| 3 | All agents that create or reference roadmap/backlog/plan require and use initiative + initiative_name; output paths and examples follow ID grammar | Agent definitions updated; no coordination artifact creation without initiative fields |
| 4 | All skills that reference plans, backlogs, roadmaps, or .docs/canonical follow the convention (examples, paths, templates) | Skills updated; ticket-management, planning, and any skill touching canonical docs aligned |
| 5 | Validation: grep and spot-check confirm no creation of roadmap/backlog/plan without initiative + initiative_name; all references by initiative | Validation report clean; convention followed to the "T" |

## Out of scope (this roadmap)

- Changing the artifact-conventions charter or .docs/ layout.
- Migrating consumer repos (they adopt when using these agents).
