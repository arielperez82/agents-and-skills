# Charter: PM Skills Intake

## Intent

- Integrate selected PM skill content (from the Product-Manager-Skills sandbox or [Dean Peters' repo](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)) into `skills/product-team/`.
- Expand product-team coverage with high-value additions while preserving repo conventions.
- Keep the intake traceable through canonical artifacts and wave-based execution.

## Problem statement

The PM skill intake work was initiated under an incorrect initiative number (`I10-PMSI`), which conflicts with `I10-ARFE` and creates ambiguity in tracking and references. The work itself is valid, but initiative identification and artifact lineage must be corrected.

## Primary approach

1. Establish the correct initiative ID: `I11-PMSI`.
2. Maintain wave-based execution for backlog items B01-B10.
3. Track progress in canonical backlog and plan artifacts under `I11-PMSI`.
4. Update product-team skill documentation and catalogs as intake waves complete.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Add and adapt PM skills and references in `skills/product-team/`.
- Canonical documentation for charter, roadmap, backlog, and plan under `I11-PMSI`.
- Update references and in-file mentions from `I10-PMSI` to `I11-PMSI`.

**Out of scope:**

- Re-opening completed `I10-ARFE` scope.
- Changing technical behavior outside PM skill content and canonical documentation.

## Success metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Initiative clarity | All PMSI canonical docs use `I11-PMSI` |
| Execution progress | B01-B05 complete and tracked; B06-B10 explicitly planned |
| Catalog coherence | Product-team and global skills catalogs updated in final wave |
